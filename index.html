        <p> All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web. </p>
        <p> In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it. </p>
        
        <p> <strong> What is HTML? </strong> </p>
        <p> HTML stands for <strong> HyperText Markup Language. </strong> It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language). </p>
        <p> HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites. </p>
        
        <p> In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> The opening tag </li>
            <li> The closing tag </li>
            <li> The actual element </li>
        </ul>
        <p> You can learn more at the <a href = ”https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/” target = "_blank" > MDN Web Docs. </a> </p>

        <p> <strong> Why should you learn HTML? </strong> </p>
        <p> There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> To be able to use the fundamental web dev language </li>
            <li> To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix </li>
            <li> To build web applications </li>
            <li> To impress friends </li>
            <li> To have fun 😃 </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time! </p>
